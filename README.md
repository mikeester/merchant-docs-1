import crypto from 'crypto';

const publicKey = 'your_public_key';
const secretKey = 'your_secret_key';
const currencyCode = 'currency_code';
const walletAddress = 'your_wallet_address';

const originalUrl = `https://checkout.bitinvestor.net?apiKey=${publicKey}&currencyCode=${currencyCode}&walletAddress=${walletAddress}`;
const signature = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secretKey).update(new URL(originalUrl).search).digest('base64');
const urlWithSignature = `${originalUrl}&signature=${encodeURIComponent(signature)}`;

console.log(urlWithSignature);
```

### Example iFrame URL:
